## ❄️ 1. Challenge Overview

**Focus:** Social Engineering & Phishing Attacks
**Objective:** Learn how attackers use phishing emails to harvest credentials and understand how such attacks are created using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET).

---

## 🧭 2. Environment Setup

* Platform: TryHackMe AttackBox
* Access Type: Web-based VM
* User Context: Attacker simulation (training environment)
* Privilege Escalation: Not required

**Tools Used:**
`setoolkit`, `browser`, `email template engine`

---

## 🎣 3. Phishing Fundamentals

Phishing is a social engineering technique used to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as:

* Usernames
* Passwords
* Email credentials

Attackers often impersonate trusted brands, services, or internal communications to increase success rates.

---

## 🧰 4. Using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

SET is a penetration testing framework designed for social engineering attacks.

**Key capabilities demonstrated:**

* Creating phishing email templates
* Hosting fake login pages
* Capturing submitted credentials

SET abstracts the technical complexity, making phishing attacks easy to deploy.

---

## 📧 5. Phishing Exercise (TBFC Scenario)

In this task, a phishing campaign is simulated against a fictional organization (TBFC).

**Steps involved:**

1. Launch SET
2. Select Social Engineering Attacks
3. Choose Phishing Attack Vectors
4. Configure email and credential harvesting

**Outcome:**

* A phishing page is generated
* Victim interaction results in credential capture

---

## 🧠 6. Security Awareness Insight

This exercise highlights:

* How convincing phishing emails can be
* Why users are the weakest link in security
* The importance of email filtering and user training

---

## 🧾 7. Task Question Answers

| Question                            | Answer                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| What toolkit was used for phishing? | Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)  |
| What attack type was demonstrated?  | Credential harvesting phishing |
| What is the main goal of phishing?  | To steal sensitive information |

---

## 🏁 8. Final Assessment

**Skills Practiced:**

* Understanding phishing workflows
* Using SET for social engineering simulations
* Recognizing real-world phishing risks

**Blue Team Relevance:**
Defenders must implement user awareness training, email security gateways, and incident response plans to reduce phishing impact.

---

✅ *Day 02 completed — foundational knowledge for both attackers and defenders in social engineering scenarios.*
