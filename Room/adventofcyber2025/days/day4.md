**Objective:** Understand how AI is used to enhance detection, investigation, response, and decision-making across cyber security domains.

**Status:** Completed (100%)  
**Estimated Time:** ~30 minutes  

---

## 🧭 2. Environment & Learning Context

- **Platform:** TryHackMe  
- **Room Type:** Conceptual + Guided Practical  
- **Role:** Security Learner / Analyst  
- **Privilege Escalation:** Not required  

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Machine Learning (ML)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Behavioural analysis  
- Security automation  

---

## 🤖 3. AI in Cyber Security — Core Concepts

Artificial Intelligence enables security systems to:

- Process and correlate large volumes of data
- Detect anomalies beyond static, rule-based systems
- Automate repetitive and time-consuming security tasks
- Provide context and summaries for security events

**Key Insight:**  
AI improves speed and scale, but does **not** replace human judgement.

---

## 🔍 4. AI Use Cases in Security Operations

### Defensive Security (Blue Team)

- Threat and malware detection
- Phishing identification
- Anomaly detection in logs and network traffic
- Automated response actions (host isolation, blocking IOCs)

AI agents act as **SOC assistants**, enriching alerts and reducing analyst fatigue.

---

### Offensive Security (Red Team)

- Reconnaissance and OSINT automation
- Parsing scanner results
- Attack surface mapping
- Supporting exploit development

AI helps pentesters focus on strategy rather than repetitive tasks.

---

### Secure Software Development

- SAST / DAST vulnerability scanning
- Code review assistance
- Identifying insecure patterns

⚠️ AI can **find vulnerabilities better than it can write secure code**, making human review essential.

---

## ⚖️ 5. Benefits and Limitations of AI

### Advantages
- Faster detection and response
- Scales across massive datasets
- Improves accuracy over time

### Limitations & Risks
- Bias in training data
- False positives / false negatives
- Adversarial attacks on AI models
- Over-reliance without verification

**Important:** AI output must always be validated by humans.

---

## 🧪 6. Practical AI Showcase (Van SolveIT)

Interactive AI demonstrations included:

- **Red Team:** Generate and execute an exploit script  
- **Blue Team:** Analyse web logs of an attack  
- **Software:** Review source code for vulnerabilities  

The showcase demonstrated how AI can assist across **offense, defense, and development** workflows.
