# Room Introduction
The Phishing Pond is designed to build practical phishing-detection skills through a set of real-world email examples. The room teaches how attackers craft deceptive messages and which red flags to look for when reviewing suspicious emails. It focuses on the most common phishing tactics, including urgency in subject lines, look-alike domains, display-name impersonation, malicious attachments, compromised sender accounts, and offers that attempt to gather personal or financial information.

The goal of the lab is simple. Review each email, decide whether it is legitimate or a phishing attempt, and identify the indicators that reveal the attacker’s intent. At the end of the challenge, the final flag is provided once all emails are correctly classified.
